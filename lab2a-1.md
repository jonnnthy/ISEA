# Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis

- Choose two printers to compare (e.g., budget inkjet vs office laser).
- List all potential costs (fixed and variable). Examples: printer, cartridges, paper, power, service.
- Define your assumptions: time period (5 years), weekly usage (750 pages), power on (40 hrs/week).
- Use online sources (e.g., Officeworks, eBay, OEM manuals) to gather pricing and specs.
- Calculate total quantity of consumables required for each printer over the chosen period.
- Create or use a spreadsheet to total all costs (use formulas).
- Compare final TCO values and reflect on the results.

## Reflection Questions
- Based on the TCO, which printer is the most cost-effective over 5 years?

The office laser printer is more cost-effective. Its total cost is much lower mainly because toner lasts longer than ink cartridges.
  
- Would the answer change for a home user who prints only 5 pages per week?

Yes. For very low usage, the inkjet may be cheaper overall because the upfront cost is lower and the user won’t consume many cartridges.
  
- What other non-financial factors could influence printer selection?

Print quality (colour/photos), speed, reliability, maintenance needs, size/noise, connectivity (Wi-Fi), and ease of getting replacement cartridges/toner.
  
- What cost components are more significant for a large workgroup printer?

Consumables (toner/ink) and paper are the biggest costs.
  
- At what point (in years/pages) do the two printer options break even in cost?
  
The break-even happens when the extra cost of the laser printer is recovered by cheaper toner usage.
Roughly around 2,000 pages (about 3 weeks at 750 pages/week).
